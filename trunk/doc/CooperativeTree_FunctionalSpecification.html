<h1><b>Cooperative Tree</b></h1>
<h2>Functional Spec</h2>
The
<b>Cooperative Tree</b>
Project aim to develop an organization helper application around a
shared tree data structure. It can be usefull for event scheduling
(movies, restaurant, party) and project managing.
<br>
The application is based on a client server model.
<br>
Users will interact with each other though a shared data structure.
<br>
<br><br>
1. Each user can propose ideas to other user by creating or adding them
as
<b>"Idea nodes"</b>
into a
<b>tree data structure</b>
.
<br>
2. An idea node can be
<b>refined by appending sub idea nodes</b>
&nbsp; to it.
<br>
<strike>4. An idea node can be appended to many other idea
nodes. It allow to not duplicate information when needed. It implies
that an IdeaNode can't has itself has child or sub Child.</strike>
For next version
<br>
5. If a user agrees an other user's idea-node he
<b>can vote for it</b>
, each
<b>vote has the same weight</b>
.
<br>
7. User can propose
<b>counter idea-nodes</b>
for a given idea-node. A new
<b> "competitive node" then replace the first idea</b>
. This competitive node then contains the first and all the counter
ideas and the counter idea.
<br>
8. To find out that as been decide so far, a
<b>validation policy</b>
as to be choosen. This validation policy will be used to compute if an
idea node will be present in the
<b>final validated tree</b>
.
<br>
9. In the
<b>default validation policy</b>
, only idea node with
<b>at least one vote</b>
is validated. For idea nodes
<b>belonging to a competitive node</b>
, only the idea node with
<b>the highest vote count is validated</b>
. if two&nbsp; idea node have the same vote count, none of the idea
nodes are validated.
<br>
10. An idea node contains :
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a
<b>title name</b>
(short length), that is display in the tree, an represents briefly the
meaning.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a
<b>description</b>
(long length), that is display as a pop-up to have a accurate
understanding of the meaning.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the reference of the
<b>creator</b>
of the idea node.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the reference of all user
<b>who votes</b>
this idea.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the
<b>total count</b>
of votes for this idea-node
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is this the interface method that user can use :
<br>
<br>
- Node appendNew(Node parent)
<br>
- Node insertNewBefore(Node parent,Node Brother)
<br>
- remove(Node)
<br>
- setName(Node node,String name)
<br>
- setCreator(Node node,String creator)
<br>
- setDescription(Node node,String description)
<br>
- vote(Node node,String voter)
<br>
- Node appendCompetitive(Node parent,Node targetNode)
<br>
- Node insertCompetitiveBefore(Node parent,Node targetNode)
